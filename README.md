### Developed a Network Traffic Analysis Tool using Python, Scapy and matplotlib libraries to capture and analyze network traffic to detect potential attacks, such as DDoS, port scanning, and brute force attacks.
#### Implemented various network traffic analysis techniques such as statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and signature-based detection to identify potential attacks in real-time.
#### Created a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt5 to display the network traffic data and visualization results.
#### Conducted testing and validation of the tool using simulated network traffic and real-world data, resulting in accurate and reliable detection of potential attacks.
#### Contributed to the open-source community by sharing the tool on Github, which received positive feedback and contributions from other developers.
